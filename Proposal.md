## Overview

The proposed project:  Genre and Authorship prediction of the document. 



Our solution can be used in many areas like an email filter, plagiarism detection and to check the originality of the content.

## Data

We planned to scrap news articles from Chicago sun times and The New York Times. Following are the problems we will face during data collection.



Identifying correct markups to filter in the html document, 

Identifying author for each article, 

Additional delays enforced by websites for data collection.

## Method

We will use one model for genre detection and another for authorship detection. 



We plan to use the POS tagger and discriminant analysis method for genre detection. Additionally, we will use a multiple discriminant analysis method for authorship detection and we would be implementing those algorithms.

## Evaluation

After data collection, we will keep aside some articles and run through our proposed solution. We will compare the results and provide the error rate. This metric will provide the effectiveness of our approach. 



Additionally, we can test our proposed solution to articles of different length/words count to see the change behavior. This would give us the Text length related to the accuracy for author identification and genre detection plots.
